I knewww everyone would start dating someone and probably get married while I am gone considering the timing. I am convinced i havent met my husband yet. Keller has emailed me every once and a while but I dont see a future at all there. The Philippines is actually crazy. The adjustment wasnt as bad as i thought it would be. Its SO hot. And summer is around the corner. Im scared because in Pangasinan it can get up to 120\u2070 so uhhh. The food is great actually. I havent had to take a bucket shower yet. I am in a good first area. The bugs are something else tho. A cockroach here in there and some new discoveries. My first companion was great! She is american and we had a lot of fun. It was nice because she went through exactly what I did but it was hard too because she was going home after training me and seeing how excited sbe was had me jealous. Then after my training i was called as a trainer which was a good push. Hard but good for me. My companion is good too. We are very different so having fun together is hard but it works. The cultural differences are funny let me just say. Anyway I am doing well!! Time is flying but not. Take care always!! Liv will probably get engaged and hopefully i can make it for the wedding. Good luck with school and everything! I dont miss exams but i really do miss provo.

Now I'm in a neighborhood called Agronomia in Porto Alegre. It's pretty cool. Lots and lots of hills, so that 6 months till slim plan, I'm in all in. My companion is Elder Burnett. He's from Kennewick, Washington. This week was great. I'm going to copy and paste the miracles we had below. (once again, sorry if there is weird Grammer, I had to translate it all.) -We were finishing our day and felt that we needed to stop by the house of a member who was inactive. We went there and she was very sick. We used our priesthood power and authority as representatives of Jesus Christ, and healed her in the name of the Lord! She immediately got better and was healed and introduced us to her niece, Andressa, who is not baptized! We explained clearly and set a date with Andressa to be baptized for the 16th! Miracles are happening!!! -ONLY MIRACLESSSSSSS Good morning, Viam\u00e3o!!! When we were walking to a friend's house, we received a feeling from the Spirit so strong that we had to knock on the door of another friend we met the other day. We went in, met him and his family, visited them, and brought a Spirit they had never felt before. We invited them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ here in three weeks and they ACCEPTED. The mother said that she had been feeling a few weeks ago that she needed to be baptized again. Now they can with the RESTORED AUTHORITY!!! \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a #s\u00f3\ud83c\udf0a #poderdonomedeJesusCristo -Miracles are at hand, in Viam\u00e3o, broz\u00e3o. Guys, we left early to meet with one of our researchers. At the only time she would be home. We went there, we found a need, which is that she lost her father and wants to meet him again. And the interest is that she wants to be a better person. We explained with *clearness* that when she is baptized these two matters will be fulfilled. We invited her to prepare to be baptized on the 9th, and because of the Spirit that was present. Of course she accepted. #SIAM\u00c3O #PRAYERSOFTHEFAITHFUL This link has all of my mission pictures. Click on it to see. FEBRUARY 10 Two weeks in a row??? Look at my progress, two weeks in a row. Anyways, this week was pretty interesting so let's get into it. Tuesday was maybe the hottest I've ever been in my entire life. Literally the worst heat ever. My companion and I just walked around slowly in the roads like zombies in a zombie apocalypse. Literally, we got nothing done that day. Nothing... I was so hot that my entire tie got soaked with sweat. I'm hoping I can get past this Ga\u00facho summer.... Wednesday we had a pretty rewarding miracle! There is a lady in our area that has been going to church for about 3 months. She never got baptized because nobody could get permission from the mission president. (weird living situation) She technically lives on the same lot as her druggy ex-husband, but he lives in a separate house. He's has his stuff and she's has her stuff. When I got there to visit her, I had a spiritual prompting to take a video of her house to prove to the mission president that she doesn't live with her ex husband anymore. President saw the video and approved her baptism. The rest of the week we were running around preparing her for her baptism and trying to teach the many people we have that are progressing. Sunday we had the baptism of Irm\u00e3 Susete! It was such a rewarding experience and she was so excited to finally be able to be baptised! Alma 32:16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. It was awesome to see how certain she was in her decision to be baptized. She wasn't baptized with stubborness in her heart. She immediately believed in our words, she felt the words enter her heart and knew that they were true. I love being a missionary. I've learned more in these last 17 months than I did in my 18 years of life before my mission. Love you guys, feel free to send me an email at eli.maires@missionary.org Send me your questions!! I'll probably be able to respond next week or so."

So far, there have been over 200 unique visits to posters across campus, and this Friday we will have the first drawing for prizes. We have a LOT of great prizes, so keep looking for posters and learning about these amazing key figures. I'm also writing to invite you to two events tomorrow, February 12: the Rhythm 'n' Soul Collective concert in the HBLL Auditorium at noon, and the \"Stories of Life\" event in the Marriot Center at 6:30 (at which Rhythm 'n' Soul will also be performing, along with others). These events both promise to be entertaining and a lot of fun, so I hope you make time to go. See the attached flyers for more details.

Peter Leman Associate Professor of English Africana Studies Faculty Coordinator ________________________________ From: Peter Leman Sent: Tuesday, February 11, 2025 12:51 PM Subject: Black History Month Events Dear All, I hope you are enjoying the semester and have joined in the Black History Month scavenger hunt. So far, there have been over 200 unique visits to posters across campus, and this Friday we will have the first drawing for prizes. We have a LOT of great prizes, so keep looking for posters and learning about these amazing key figures. I'm also writing to invite you to two events tomorrow, February 12: the Rhythm 'n' Soul Collective concert in the HBLL Auditorium at noon, and the \"Stories of Life\" event in the Marriot Center at 6:30 (at which Rhythm 'n' Soul will also be performing, along with others). These events both promise to be entertaining and a lot of fun, so I hope you make time to go. See the attached flyers for more details. All the best, Professor Leman Peter Leman, Ph.D. (he/him) Associate Professor of English Africana Studies Faculty Coordinator Brigham Young University *BYU sits on the ancestral homelands of the Ute, Paiute, and Shoshone peoples.

I got transferred to an area called humait\u00e1, it's in Porto Alegre next to the gremio arena if you wanna see what it looks like. It's very very crowded, and what they call in Brazil a \"favela\" But it's been good. My companion is from Osorno Chile, and we are serving as leaders in a zone called Moinhos de vento. Unfortunately we haven't seen some of the success we are wanting, but we are continuing onward ever onward. And I know that as we keep on going on we will see miracles in our work. I have really realized recently how God is so good to me and my family. And I know that because I'm sacrificing 2 years of my life God will take care of my family. Love all you guys and until next Time. (there should be a next time) se deus quiser. (January 13th) What's up guys? How's it going? I don't have a ton of time to write this. I'm 2 for 2 on weekly writing. In the mission we have been putting miracles in our zones group chat. I wanted to copy and paste these miracles. Sorry if some of them don't make sense. I'll have to pass them through the translator. *HOLY FREAKING BIG MIRACLES*\ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd79 GOD IS GOOD FAMILY so we left today after the Zone meeting with a purpose and a desire to see miracles. We were walking down the street when a man called us, That's when we met our friend Cristiano He started telling his story, about how he found out about the church through his grandmother who gave lunch to the sisters there in Arroio dos Ratos more than 35 years ago. We left a powerful prayer with him, his wife Aline, and his son Nicolas. It was very, very spiritual. We took advantage of the spirit and invited the 3 of them to be baptized on the 19th and accepted. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\ude4f (the three recently visited the church in the Nilo Wulff wing and now have sacramentals) People, miracles really are real for those who serve God with all their heart, mind, and strength. This miracle was pretty special. Even though it didn't work out in the end I really felt the spirit strongly. Good afternoon, Moinhos De Vento area \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udcaf We visited our date yesterday and the guy disappeared, but we found her cousin Thaisa, she is incredible, her grandmother passed away 5 months ago, we left a powerful prayer, and we didn't just leave the spirit. We took advantage of the spirit and invited her to be baptized on the 19th, she cried (and almost us too) and said that she will be baptized on the 19th, yes \ud83e\udd79 Miracles are real people, let's go!! This one also didn't work out too well but. We are still working with her, her family and her friends. If you guys could say a quick prayer for Thaisa, Erica and Lucas. It would mean a lot to a lot of people."

Sister San Diego is so kind and it's been fun to get to know each other. Nanay Lily said she'll be baptized! Let's just hope that she goes to church 3 more times in a row. We went to our \"Christmas Luncheon\" with half of the mission and it was so fun to celebrate the birth of our Savior and to celebrate with my mission family. We all ate together, enjoyed 2 hours of musical numbers, and heard an amazing message from President Foster. Anddd I bawled almost the entire time (embarrassing). Everyone thought I was homesick BUT I was overwhelmed with the spirit. As I sat there listening to Elder Orton singing a song about having room for Jesus Christ in our Inn, I reflected on how cool my mission is. I am literally bringing \"good tidings of great joy\" like the angel did to the shepherd's on the night of our Savior's birth. And I do it every day! This will be my most Christ centered Christmas yet. I am so thankful for my Savior. He is our redeemer. I am honored to be one of His chosen vessels. Merry Christmas!! I hope you're enjoying the holiday season and drinking lots of hot chocolate for me! \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf85 \u2764\ufe0f Sister Ryser"

                "body": "During our INTEX presentation, we received valuable feedback that helped us improve our presentation. One key piece of advice was to ensure that the viewer can always see the screen, regardless of the room setup. We were told that the content displayed is often more important than the presenter\u2019s visibility. Another important suggestion was to avoid undermining our work and to speak with confidence, carefully choosing our words to demonstrate 100% certainty in our recommendations. If we hope to convince other's to do something, we must be convinced ourselves. Lastly, we were advised to always tie each graph and slide back to the story we are telling. This is crucial because the goal of our presentation is to inspire change and motivate our audience to take action. We cannot achieve this if our main idea is weak or lacks solid support. As promised, we took great care to ensure that the viewer could always see the screen, no matter the room setup, because we knew it was crucial for them to engage with the information we were presenting. We were also very deliberate in our word choice and tone, striving to convey confidence and clarity in both our recommendation to Julie and the data backing it up. Each graph, chart, and suggestion we made was directly tied to the overarching message: that Julie should start an Airbnb listing and renovate it. We didn\u2019t just present data for the sake of it; we made sure to explain how each piece of information was relevant to her specific situation. By connecting each visual element to the story, we were able to clearly explain why Julie should consider renovating and listing her house on Airbnb. This approach helped strengthen the rationale behind our recommendation and made it easier for Julie to see the benefits of taking action. We wanted the presentation to feel like a cohesive, persuasive argument that encouraged Julie to make an informed, confident decision, and we believe we did just that."
